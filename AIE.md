# 'AIE' Dialect

This is a dialect for describing netlists of AIE components in a
Versal device.  It focuses on representing logical stream connections
between cores and DMAs, along with the implementation of those logical
connections in the various switch components.  In the dialect, a
switch is referred to as `switchbox` to avoid confusion with the
`switch` keyword in C/C++.
